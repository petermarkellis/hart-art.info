title: Interview with the National Portrait Gallery, London showcasing 20 years
  of my work
description: >-
  I'm honored to share that the National Portrait Gallery in London has invited
  me for an exclusive interview and retrospective feature celebrating two
  decades of my artistic journey. The interview, conducted by senior curator
  James Whitmore, delves into the evolution of my style, the inspirations behind
  some of my most recognized pieces, and the challenges of maintaining artistic
  integrity in an ever-changing art world.


  During our conversation, we explored how my early watercolor experiments in the late 1990s gradually evolved into the bold oil paintings that have become my signature. Whitmore was particularly interested in discussing my "Urban Landscapes" series from 2015, which marked a significant shift in both technique and subject matter. "Looking back at those pieces now, I can see how they represented not just a change in my work, but a response to the rapid transformation of European cities," I reflected during the interview.


  The feature will be published in the Gallery's quarterly magazine next month and will include reproductions of key works from each phase of my career. The National Portrait Gallery has also expressed interest in acquiring one piece for their permanent collection, which would be an incredible milestone. For those unable to visit London, the full interview will be available on the Gallery's website, along with a virtual tour of selected works from my portfolio.


  This recognition from such a prestigious institution feels like validation of the path I've chosen, but more importantly, it's a reminder of why I create art in the first place—to connect with people and share perspectives that might otherwise go unseen.
