  The Berlin National Art Gallery has announced an exciting new exhibition
  featuring contemporary works from emerging and established artists across
  Europe. The showcase, titled "Perspectives: Modern Voices in Art," will open
  to the public on March 15th and run through June 30th, 2025.


  Curated by renowned art historian Dr. Marina Schmidt, the exhibition brings together over 60 pieces spanning multiple mediums including painting, sculpture, and mixed media installations. The collection emphasizes the diverse perspectives and innovative techniques that define today's European art scene. "We wanted to create a dialogue between different artistic traditions and contemporary experimentation," Schmidt explained during the preview event last week.


  Among the featured artists are several local talents alongside internationally recognized names. The exhibition will include daily guided tours, weekend workshops for aspiring artists, and a series of evening talks where visitors can meet some of the artists and learn about their creative processes. Entry to the gallery remains free for students and seniors, with standard admission priced at €12 for adults.

  The Berlin National Art Gallery is located in the heart of the Museum District and is easily accessible by public transport. Gallery hours are Tuesday through Sunday, 10 AM to 6 PM, with extended hours until 9 PM on Thursdays.
