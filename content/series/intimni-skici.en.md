description: "*Intimni Skici* (Intimate Sketches) is the title of a collection
  of piano miniatures by Janáček which was published in 1994, 66 years after the
  composer's death. In my homage to Janáček I created my own \"compositions\" in
  an old notebook of manuscript paper. After having drawn and painted directly
  on score fragments, I found it very liberating to have only the horizontal
  lines of the staff as a point of departure."
