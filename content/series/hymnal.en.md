  For one week in December of 2002 the Lutheran Paul-Gerhart-Church in Cologne
  staged the art exhibit Church Songs as Objects of Art. The church had replaced
  its old hymnals with a new edition and, instead of disposing of them, hit upon
  the idea of inviting artists to creatively respond to the book.


  In my contribution I responded quite spontaneously to the contents of the hymns and their notation. A certain word, a particular verse or the musical notation itself provoked a reaction on my part. I gave answer to the words and notes by embellishing, transforming or obliterating them.mixed media on hymnal cover and pages, 18,5 cm x 11 cm x 3,3 cm
