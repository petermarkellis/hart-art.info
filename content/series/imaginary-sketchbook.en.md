description: 'Each of these drawings resulted, directly or indirectly, from my
  working in a sketchbook. The first two, terra incognita and Trace Elements,
  which appear to be the open pages of a book but are not, refer back to
  drawings from the original sketchbook, but go far beyond them. The original
  drawings were made with pastel and covered a double page of the book. Upon
  completion I cut the binding threads to remove these pages, turned them over
  to tape them together, and - in a moment of serendipity - was surprised to
  discover traces they had left behind on the paper underneath. These "trace
  elements" became the basis of the present drawings: light, barely visible
  vestiges of movement or writing which were brought back to life with colored
  pencil and took on a completely different character than their original one:
  playful, multicolored, organic as well as geometric shapes. The last three
  drawings (Go!, Microcosm, Tail of the Comet) were made directly in the
  sketchbook and push this method still further, taking up on traces of all
  kinds, be they gestural or random.'
