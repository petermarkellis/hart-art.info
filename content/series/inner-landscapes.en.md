description: "\"Art does not reproduce the visible ‐ art makes things visible.\"
  (Paul Klee)This series deals with making subconscious processes visible. To
  borrow a phrase from Paul Klee's analogy of the artist as a tree, *I transmit
  images from the depths*, just as the roots convey nutrients upwards into the
  trunk and finally the treetop. I begin by literally feeling my way forward
  across the paper, using both hands and with eyes closed; by means of pastel
  chalk inner pictures materialise. These can be calm and meditative als well as
  impulsively expressive. They authentically reflect my state of mind without
  being consciously influenced.The quick pastel sketches provide the point of
  departure for painting in watercolour. Shapes and lines are delineated,
  expressive strokes taken up on and emphasised, colours are intensified and
  differentiated, spatial effects come about almost inadvertently. The gestural
  pastel sketch is completely transformed."
