  Movement and the element of chance both play a decisive role in my work. I
  begin by making a quick sketch, using both hands, in each one a
  different-colored piece of pastel chalk. My eyes are closed so that I have no
  cognitive control over the action taking place. In this way I can work
  impulsively without consciously influencing what is taking shape on the
  paper. 


  After producing several "action sketches" in this fashion, I evaluate their potential, pick out the most promising and continue to draw. The raw material of the sketches forms a "visual provocateur" (Max Ernst) which provides the point of departure for the drawings. By taking up and elaborating on the expressive strokes they undergo a metamorphosis: barely visible traces become delineated and emphasized, others are toned down or erased, colors are intensified and differentiated, shapes and lines assert themselves and yet, despite the high degree of transformation, the dynamism of the the original action is still evoked.
