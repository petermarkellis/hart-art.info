description: Due to a hand injury in 2012 I was unable to draw for approximately
  2 years. To my great relief, I discovered - after a long pause - that working
  with a brush, which requires much less pressure of the fingers, was possible.
  So I switched media, trading in colored pencils and pastels for brushes and
  watercolors. The liberation of being able to work again finds expression in
  these small paintings, done in a sketchbook. What at first glance appears to
  be "action painting" - rapid, spontaneous brushstrokes with no regard for
  composition - shows itself, upon closer inspection, to be quite nuanced in
  terms of color and, in the course of the series, as increasingly planned in
  terms of placement of the strokes and their division of the picture plane.
