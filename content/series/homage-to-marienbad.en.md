  These 5 watercolours began as pencil sketches which were executed very quickly
  and spontaneously, with eyes closed. They took the shape of dynamic, gestural
  strokes or small, expressive marks. Drawing without looking at what is
  evolving on the paper guarantees that the result is *direct*, from my
  innermost depths, without being consciously influenced.


  While adding color to the drawings, the background took on more and more importance. It provides an "atmosphere" of color in which playful shapes stand out, or contributes to the compositional division of the picture plane.
