  *Objet trouvé*: The entire series was inspired by a found object, an
  irregularly shaped piece of wood from the floor of the forest. Its chiselled,
  uneven surface seemed to cry out for colour. The medium of watercolour seemed
  appropriate as it stains the wood while leaving its grain and texture intact.


  *Pencil Picture*: This work was an attempt to create an appealing composition consisting of "leftover" coloured pencils. Light and shadow play an important role, as "faux shadows" visually bind the pencils to the substrate, yet combine with real shadows which of course vary depending on the lighting.


  *Totem I and II*: Both of these objects were inspired by a branch of driftwood whose surface had been engraved by worms. Fascinated by these natural marks, I decided to add color in order to bring them to light. Painting with opaque colours on a convex surface reminded me of totem poles, hence the title.*Go with the Grain, Tools of the Trade, Picture This!*: The grain, texture and subtle hues of the wood itself became the point of departure for the colours and shapes which evolved. Diverse small objects, e.g. pencil lead, erasers, a brush, were integrated through the use of "faux-shadows" or similar colours. The two different levels of the assemblages increase the 3-dimensional aspect as well as provide more possibilities to work with space.


  The new series (2023/24) picks up where the old left off. Again the rhythmical flow of the wood grain provides the initial impulse and determines the direction of movement. The natural color of the wood is utilised, but also heightened or intensified.


  The 3-dimensional quality of the assemblages is produced in various ways: by using different layers of wood which create a relief, adding objects or by chiselling into the surface. Finally the frame provides a boundary which contains the space within.


  Spoonful was a very lucky find during a walk in the woods.
