description: >-
  I utilize the formal syntax of Far Eastern calligraphy, but without its
  semantic content. My marks result spontaneously from the gestural act of
  "writing", but cannot be read in a conventional sense, even though they are
  formally arranged as written characters. They are meant to be appreciated
  visually, not in terms of content. To borrow a phrase from Marshall McLuhan,
  the medium is the message.


  All of my works have in common that expressive marks or strokes are brought to light from the depths of my subconscious.
